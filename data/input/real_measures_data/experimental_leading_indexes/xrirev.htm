<P>The Stock-Watson Experimental Coincident, Leading and Recession Indexes

<B>Trend Function in the XLI/XRI model --</B> A stochastic trend was added
to the XLI/XRI model. The trend, modeled as a random walk, was added as
a time-varying intercept in the equation relating the coincident index
to lagged values of the leading indicators. This component affects the
XLI and XRI, but does not affect the XCI.</LI>
